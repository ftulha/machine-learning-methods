Naive Bayes and Multivariate Gaussian

This is a repository for a MATLAB implementation of two supervised machine learning algorithms applied to two different problems. For Naibe Bayes we take a look at the parkinson's dataset where the goal is to predict whether a patient has the disease or not. For Multivariate Gaussian we take a look at a banknote dataset in which the prediction has to be about the notes being real or fake.
